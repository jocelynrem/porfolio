# Portfolio

## About This Website

This is a portfolio website showcasing my work.  

>Please note: I do not currently have any work to showcase so images and links in the portfolio section are placeholders.  

Check back later for updates.

## Sections

This site includes the following sections:
1. About Me
2. Portfolio Images
3. Contact Information
4. My Resume 

Currently, all sections are filled with place-holder text and images.  This will be updated as I progress further into the Bootcamp program and work more with Career Services.

## Code

Notice the CSS portion of this site includes examples of Flexbox and CSS Grid in order to make the website responsive and visually appealing.
